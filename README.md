# Smart Code Generator 💻🚀

Welcome to **Smart Code Generator**, an AI-powered tool for generating clean and efficient code in various programming languages using **StarCoder** and **Groq**. 🎯 This app leverages the power of AI to turn natural language summaries into functional code, with a clean, user-friendly interface built using **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
- **AI-Powered Code Generation**: Generate code for tasks in Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and more, by providing a summary of the task. 🤖
- **Streamlit Interface**: Easy-to-use UI to interact with the code generator. 🔥
- **Modify Generated Code**: Edit the generated code before downloading it, with an optional text area for modifications. ✏️
- **Download Generated Code**: Download the generated (or modified) code as a `.txt` file. 📥
- **Multiple Programming Languages**: Choose from a variety of languages to generate code in. 🌐

## 💻 How It Works
This tool uses **Groq's API** to generate code through the **StarCoder** model based on a brief summary of the task. Simply provide a description of what you need, select the language, and let the AI do the rest!

### Key Features:
- **Task Summary Input**: Enter a brief task description (e.g., "Create a function to add two numbers").
- **Language Selection**: Choose from Python, Java, JavaScript, or C++ for the generated code.
- **Real-Time Code Generation**: Once the summary is entered, click "Generate Code" to instantly receive functional code.
- **Edit and Download**: Option to modify generated code before downloading as a `.txt` file.
